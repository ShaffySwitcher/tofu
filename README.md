# Tofu

Tofu is a barebones scripting language for people who have use-cases for using shell scripts but don't like their syntax, features, size or platform dependance. Tofu is platform-agnostic (except for the commands you run) and the language specification is very small.

**This repository is brand-new and the program isn't ready to be used yet.**

Tofu has a small specification and feature-set. You can begin learning how to use it in the links below
